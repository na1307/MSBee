# MSBuild Extras – Toolkit for .NET 1.1 “MSBee”
MSBee stands for MSBuild Everett Environment. It is an extension to MSBuild that allows developers to build managed applications in Visual Studio 2005 targeting .NET 1.1.

Originally hosted on Microsoft's CodePlex, this project was lost after the CodePlex service was discontinued. However, fortunately, the source code was recovered and has been restored here!

Please note that MSBee only works properly with Visual Studio 2005. It will not function on later versions of Visual Studio without code modifications, and the newer the version, the more issues you may encounter.

Therefore, it is not recommended to use this in practice. If you really want to use it, consider setting up a Windows XP virtual machine.

MSBee 1.0 can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/na1307/MSBee/raw/refs/heads/original/MSBee%201.0%20Release.zip).

This software is provided "as-is" for archival purposes.
